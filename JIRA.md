# New Bugtracker #
We've switched to a new [JIRA Bugtracker](https://wowmodelviewer.atlassian.net/browse/WMV). Please post your bugs and issues there.

## What about the old issues? ##
We will still work on fixing the old issues, but new issues will be deleted.
All these issues are viewable on our JIRA bugtracker, just search an issue with the same title as your old one on wowmodelviewer google tracker.


Feel free to ask for support on our [forum](http://www.womodelviewer.org/forum).
